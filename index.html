      <h2>Welcome to my Page</h2>
      <p class="my-intro">Hi there! I am an electrical engineer who graduated in 2017 from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.
        I discovered programming while messing around during my long free time after graduation and fell in love with it,
        I even developed a simple game called Fortuna using one of the most permitive game developing libraries known as "pygame" while all my knowledge came from random tutorials on youtube.
        In my free time I play video games, read novels, listen to music, and as you might guess, programming.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I know I am nowhere near proficient at coding yet, but I love learning it and applying my knowledge to build fun projects like a game or a website.
           I have a basic knowledge and exposure to various programming languages such as Python, C#, HTML, CSS.</p>

        <h3>Computer Literacy</h3>
        <p>Throughout my studies at the university and even before that, I've been using computers all the time. I know the basics of building a computer (I built my own).
          More importantly, I utilized multiple computer applications throught the years. The most notable ones are: Microsoft office Suit, AutoCAD2D, Matlab.</p>

        <h3>Report Writing</h3>
        <p>During my time at the university, I handled writing the report of almost all the projects I was a part of and it was always one of the strongest points of the project.
          That's because I follow one simple rule: don't write something you don't want to read.</p>

        <h3>Fortuna: A Game Programmed With Python</h3>
        <p>This strange game was programmed when I started learning Python. Even though I began programming other games later and ended up not finishing them because
        I felt they were too generic and simple, somehow I did finish programming this game. Fun fact: the game concept was inspired by a documantry about
        witch hunting in early-modern europe.</p>
